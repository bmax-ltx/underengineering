# Underengineering
Most engineers know about [overengineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overengineering). But how many of us have heard of underengineering?

I think it's unfair that underengineering does not get any attention. So let me change this.

## Principles of Underengineering:

1. Why should be the first question
2. It's OK to repeat yourself (sine waves are great)
3. A lot of tests stimulate a lot of false confidence
4. Abstraction comes with a payload (i.e. context)
5. Common libraries are a common myth
6. Refactoring is often bad (see 1 though 5)
